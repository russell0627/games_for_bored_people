const String noteToDexter = """For me, many pets have come and gone. 
Dexter, was one of the best. 
He was with us for so many years, almost my entire life as of writing this. 
But alas, all good things must come to an end. I got to be there from some of his early years through to his final day. 
I loved him. He was a great dog. It was always cute when he would lie down on the floor and it would look like he was melting into it.
I will always remember him as my grandpa's best bud.

And when it is Oscar's time to go, I will put him up on the hill with Dexter, so they can be together, once more.

const String endOfGameMessage = """This is it. You finished the game. I hope you liked it.
I have poured a lot of work into this project. That just shows how important Dexter was to me.
I never knew how much I really cared about him until I lost him. He was a great dog.
Making this has let me revisit so many great memories with Dexter.
It was crazy being able to see Dexter's entire life in just pictures. We have had so many great adventures
together. It was great to have him for so many years.
I still miss him a lot.
