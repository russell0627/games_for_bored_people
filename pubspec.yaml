  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #  fonts:
  fonts:
    - family: Merienda
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/quizzez/fonts/Merienda/static/Merienda-Regular.ttf
    - family: TicTacToe
